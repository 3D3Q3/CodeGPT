# AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
CodeGPT is a new project that is in its initial stages of development. This document will be updated with essential knowledge to help AI coding agents be productive in this codebase as patterns and conventions emerge.

## Project Structure
Currently, the project has a minimal structure with:
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `.github/` - GitHub-specific configuration and documentation

## Development Workflow
As development patterns and workflows are established, they will be documented here to help AI agents understand:
- Build and test procedures
- Development environment setup
- Common development tasks
- Project-specific conventions

## Key Integration Points
As the project grows, this section will document:
- External dependencies
- Service boundaries
- Inter-component communication patterns
- Integration requirements

## Project-Specific Patterns
This section will be updated to capture unique patterns and approaches specific to this codebase as they are established.

Note: This is an initial version of the AI coding agent instructions. As the project develops, please update this document with:
- Architectural decisions and their rationale
- Critical workflows that aren't immediately obvious from code inspection
- Project-specific conventions that differ from common practices
- Examples of established patterns from the codebase
